# Muxy Mobile

Monorepo for the Muxy mobile clients.

```

The two apps are completely separate — no shared code between them. They each
talk to a Muxy server (the macOS app in `~/Projects/muxy`) over WebSocket using
the protocol defined in `ios/MuxyShared/`. The Android side has its own
re-implementation of that protocol in Kotlin.

## iOS

```sh
cd ios
open MuxyMobile.xcodeproj
# or run on a simulator:
scripts/run-mobile.sh
```

`MuxyShared/` is a local Swift package consumed by the Xcode project via
`XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "."` (i.e. it picks up `ios/Package.swift`).

## Android

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Open `android/` in Android Studio for development.

## CI

- `ios-checks` — SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, simulator build on every PR touching `ios/**`.
- `ios-release` — manual `workflow_dispatch`; archives, signs, uploads to App Store Connect.
- `android-checks` — Gradle lint, debug assemble, unit tests on every PR touching `android/**`.
- `android-release` — manual `workflow_dispatch`; builds a signed AAB and (optionally) uploads to Play Store as a draft.

iOS release secrets carried over from the original repo:
`APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
`KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`,
`APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, `APP_STORE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

Android release secrets:
`ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_BASE64` (base64 of `upload-keystore.jks`),
`ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`,
and optional `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (raw JSON; if absent the Play upload step is skipped).

For local manual releases, see `android/scripts/release.sh` and `android/RELEASE.md`.
